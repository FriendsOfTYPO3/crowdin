Where is the extension in the TYPO3 top bar
===========================================

If an extension does not appear on the Crowdin list in the TYPO3 top bar,
after you've installed it, it is probably because you need to update the language packs.
Head over to :guilabel:`ADMIN TOOLS > Maintenance > Manage Language Packs` and hit the
:guilabel:`Update all` button to get language packs for the newly installed extensions.

How to change the current language I am working on
==================================================

When you first open the Crowdin interface, you are presented with a list of
language you can choose from. But if you later want to change the language you
are working on, you can do so by clicking the icon (left) of the Crowdin Modal
Tool:

..  figure:: /Images/crowdin-tool.png
    :class: with-shadow
    :alt: Crowdin Tool
    :width: 288px

Then click the settings icon:

..  figure:: /Images/crowdin-settings.png
    :class: with-shadow
    :alt: Crowdin Settings
    :width: 500px

And finally choose another language from the list:
