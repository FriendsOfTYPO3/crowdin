Where is the extension in the TYPO3 toolbar
==============

If an extension does not appear on the Crowdin list in the TYPO3 top toolbar,
after you've installed it, it is probably because you need to update the language packs.
Head over to Admin Tool => Maintenance => Manage Language Packs and hit the
"Update all" button to get language packs for the newly installed extensions.
